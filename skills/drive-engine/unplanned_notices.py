"""Tell the operator, once, about a drive the engine keeps failing to plan (#334, #335).

A held leg (`reconcile.HeldLeg`) that still has a block on the calendar keeps
that block, so the operator sees a drive. One with no block is a drive that is
simply missing, and nothing said so: the Nov 2 home→BNA drive was absent from
the calendar with only a stderr line behind it (#335).

`due_notices` decides which missing legs to mention. A leg is mentioned once it
has been missing for `PERSIST_BEFORE_NOTICE` (a one-sweep routing blip heals on
the next sweep and is not worth a message) and only once per spell: an entry
that plans again is forgotten, so a later failure is news again. Only legs due
within `NOTICE_HORIZON` count; a drive months out has time to resolve itself.

Each schema version keeps its own file (`unplanned-notices.v<N>.json`), so
engines of different versions never read or write each other's record: after
an upgrade or a rollback the running engine starts or resumes its own, and
the cost is at most one repeated notice. Hint, not authority
(`coding-policy: stateful-artifacts`): a missing, unreadable or malformed file
reads as "nothing noticed yet", with a stderr diagnostic for anything but a
plain missing file. The cost is one repeated notice, never a missed drive.
Schema in `state-schema.md`.
